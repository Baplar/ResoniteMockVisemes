# MockVisemes
Use simple RNG to simulate viseme analysis on Resonite on Linux

## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
2. Place [MockVisemes.dll](https://github.com/baplar/ResoniteMockVisemes/releases/latest/download/MockVisemes.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create this folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Resonite logs.
